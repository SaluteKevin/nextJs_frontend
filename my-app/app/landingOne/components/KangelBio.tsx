                than her normal, real life self. 
                Her hair is instead platinum blonde with a purple gradient on her bangs, and much 
                kinder-looking baby blue eyes, with both of them being visible. She instead has long hair, 
                which she stills styles into twin tails, only going with a more eccentric blue-pink combo 
                with her twin tails swirling around each other to create something similar to that of DNA.

                Personality: <br/>
                <span className='text-white'>
                She puts on a
                <span className="text-[#2bd9ff] italic">
                 manic pixie dream girl 
                </span> 
                persona, and pretends to be incredibly kind and sweet. 
                She is also known to flirt with her fans, more specifically the otaku types. Unlike her off-stream self, 
                she's incredibly bold and talks condescendingly (yet lovingly) to haters and fans alike. KAngel's facade 
                rarely breaks unless Ame is sufficiently stressed out, 
                <span className="text-red-500 underline italic">
                 but Ame's real personality might show to a downplayed 
                extent here and there.
